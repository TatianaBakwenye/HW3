##### Try to use map and reduce in the next 3 exercises
# 1)
# Create a function called "count_simba" that counts
# the number of times that Simba appears in a list of
# strings. Example: 
# ["Simba and Nala are lions.", "I laugh in the face of danger.",
#  "Hakuna matata", "Timon, Pumba and Simba are friends, but Simba could eat the other two."] 
#
simbalist = ["Simba and Nala are lions.", "I laugh in the face of danger.", "Hakuna matata", "Timon, Pumba and Simba are friends, but Simba could eat the other two."] 
def count_simba(x):
    numb = sum(map(lambda s: s.count("Simba"), x))
    print(f'"Simba appears {numb} times')
count_simba(simbalist)

# 2)
# Create a function called "get_day_month_year" that takes 
# a list of datetimes.date and returns a pandas dataframe
# with 3 columns (day, month, year) in which each of the rows
# is an element of the input list and has as value its 
# day, month, and year.

    data = pd.DataFrame(map(lambda z: [z.day, z.month, z.year]  , y ))
    return data

get_day_month_year(date_list)

# 3) 
# Create a function called "compute_distance" that takes
# a list of tuple pairs with latitude and longitude coordinates and 
# returns a list with the distance between the two pairs
# example input: [((41.23,23.5), (41.5, 23.4)), ((52.38, 20.1),(52.3, 17.8))]
# HINT: You can use geopy.distance in order to compute the distance
#
